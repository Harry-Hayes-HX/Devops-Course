# Debugging

Learn to:
 * Get visibility into a deployed cloud setup to investigate problems

Your coach will now deliberately break your deployment — sorry!

Pushing a new commit to the code will now fail to deploy it. Find out why (there might be more than one problem)

## Reflection

Using sticky notes, include on your diagram the different problems you found (where they were located, and their root cause).

Ask your coach for a check-in once this is done.
