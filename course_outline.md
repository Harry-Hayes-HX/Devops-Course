## Tracking your learning

It is highly encouraged to keep some sort of log where you track your learning, new concepts and tools you encounter.

Ideally, you'd also keep a backlog of items you'd like to revisit when you get some time. In certain weeks, you may find yourself with more time than in others, and this is completely normal and expected. So, ideally, from time to time you'd revisit some of the items in your backlog and spend some time researching, learning, etc.

Below you can find some means to track your learning, but feel free to explore some alternatives that may work better for you. You're, after all, the captain of your boat :boat:

- Blogging
- Trello board
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) board
- GitHub repository: [example 1](https://github.com/amitness/learning) (quite extensive!), [example 2](https://github.com/chiubaca/learning)
- Notes app (e.g. Notion, Evernote, Notes on Mac)

:bulb: If you feel really inspired, you could even organise a lightning talk for your cohort!

Need even more inspiration? Check out [this file](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/self_directed_learning/resources/tracking_your_learning.md) from the Software Development course.
